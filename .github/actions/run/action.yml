# The whole point of this action is just to be a "generic" action to any local dockerfile
# why not just `uses: docker://local/playground-actions/run` after building image
# becuase github action always try to pull docker image before any steps so that won't work
# then why not pushing image to remote repository first?
# (it's an answer but also a question) why I would want that when I don't have to?
# so this is the best compromise I have come up with so far

  # image: Dockerfile # this should work except it won't for my job
